###Tony Yayo & Danny Brown - Hawaiian Snow

Even though Danny Brown is super popular at the moment, no one seems to talk about this mixtape.  
Its my third favorite DB album after XXX and Black & Brown.  Tony Yayo is pretty good too.  The beats are good, Danny Brown is on it, 
and they even got Lil B on a feature.

###Milo - things that happen at day

Milo is a cool guy that raps about interesting things, like philosophy.  The beats are awesome and
listening to him makes me feel like a (pseudo-)intellectual.

###Jeremiah Jae & Oliver the 2nd - RawHyde

This is some serious pbr, 3D glasses, vintage t-shirt and overalls shit.  It has like 80 listeners on last.fm.  I don't know why though,
I think it's pretty great.  The production on this is amazing and unique.  Lyrics are good too and mesh well with the beats.
