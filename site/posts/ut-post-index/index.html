  <p>My senior year of school, I blogged for the UT Austin computer science department. Here are all the posts I wrote for them, loosely categorized.</p>

<h2>Posts I Liked</h2>

<h3>It Gets Better <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/blog/it-gets-better-part-1">(Part 1)</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/blog/it-gets-better-part-2">(Part 2)</a></h3>

<p>In part 1, I write about the loneliness and frustration I felt my first few years of college. Part 2 is kind of a speech about sympathy for the lonely and how I've changed my life since freshman year. I poured my heart out in part 2, I was shaking in the library while I was writing it. It's the post that received the most feedback.</p>
