everyone says 90% of writing is revising
i agreed up till last week but now the idea pains me
editing seems so clinical
my editing is a shitty make-up job on top of actual feeling
and sometimes it cracks so some emotion leaks out but most of it still seems overdressed, artificial, creepy doll-like
like you don't want a single person in the world to think you're ugly
so you overcompensate, hiding everything, painting a completely new face

there's no feeling in my editing
maybe i'm doing it wrong
but what could be more natural than what poured out of you when you're fingers were on the keyboard?
what could be more unnatural than going back in time to the middle of your sentence and changing a word to a longer one because you think it flows better? if it flowed better it would've came out of you the first time, right? 

i don't like this new wave of 'brevity is king' shit
where bloggers optimize for our trash attention spans by writing at a first grade level 
and they'll start with natural sounding sentences like, 'write short sentences so your audience doesn't get bored' and then think *NINE WORDS, GOD DAMN, THIS IS TURNING INTO A TEXTBOOK. how can i cut this in half? how can i make this PUNCHY? i need a good word? tersely? lemme pull up a thesaurus*
and after a few minutes of cutting they'll end up with 'Write tersely.'
or just tweet instead
and the small nuances that appear in their natural flow of thought that would actually distinguish them from the 1000s of other SEO optimized blogs disappear and we are left with a blog post that is just a slight permutation of words from the other 10000 blog posts about writing tersely

maybe i'm wrong and this blog post would be much better as seven five word aphorisms
terse writing is it's own kind of art i guess and it's fun to read in it's own way
and it has it's own place in the world
like dishwasher manuals
but even then, wouldn't it be fun to read a dishwasher manual that was just filled with passion? with grand metaphors and biblical references?

edited writing can be made beautiful too but it feels different
emotions generate the drive to write, generate the language, and so the language you used, right then, why shouldn't that be perfect?

could you imagine a poet stopping halfway through a verse to consider whether the theme of his poem fit the overall vibe of the collection?

there's just something beautiful about spontaneous speech
could by why podcasts are so popular
and so there's something beautiful about spontaenous writing
it's why Kerouac is famous
he wrote all of on the road in 3 days on amphetamines on one long scroll, no edits and yeah some of it is shitty but that can be said about most books
but when it works it really works
 
when i write i write painfully and stuntedly until one day i'm editing for the 100th time and say fuck this this is terrible i'm getting nowhere and just re-write half of it in a thirty minute burst of enthusiasm and then i try to not touch it because i know that those moments of thoughtless intuition are the only important ones
but since thirty minutes is my cap and its still only half done i have to dilute that gift from my subconscious with numb glue and filler and padding
but even getting any feeling at all out of myself meets my bar

look at this video of desiigner screaming adlibs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei9SLZHQlqc

you think he pensively goes back to the lyrics of Panda, written in a composition notebook, pauses for a moment, and carefully switches a DRRRRRRRAAAA to a GIT GIT GIT
no
he definetely just gets hype as fuck and lets the words pour out of him and so the words are just a manifestation of feeling
as opposed to the words being manipulated to evoke an emotion
it's the difference between a Thor 2 and Gummo

and so now i write like i'm journaling
i write like a 13 year old girl on 2010 tumblr with no self awareness
i write to express and not to communicate
because writing with an audience in mind will never be transcendent
and yeah this isn't transcendent either
but why block the possibility?
why think "i will never have a stroke of creative inspiration so i'm just going to read 7 Tips For Writing Quality Content so i can maximize reach"

isn't living fully about passion
i'll read this shit anywhere
i want to see yelp reviews of taco bell like
I SALIVATED NOT AT THE BEAUTY OF THE CASHIER BUT AT THE MEXICAN PIZZA IN FRONT OF ME, WARM, SENSUAL, MOIST WITH FIRE SAUCE AND IN THOSE MOMENTS ALL HESITATION DISSAPATED, ALL THE *JACK DON'T DO THIS AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO SHIT BLOOD TOMORROW MORNING* AND I TORE INTO IT WITH ABANDON AND MASHED BEANS DRIPPED OFF MY NOSE AND DOWN MY CHIN AND ONLOOKERS GAPED AT THIS BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF PURE LUST, PIZZA AND MAN BECOMING ONE

not

Got two Mexican Pizzas. Taste: 5/5. Good location, good service. -2 stars for diarrhea the next morning.

yeah its shorter but its boring
life is emotional and i think everything can be elevated
there's probably a balance, but with all these listicles i think it's safe to over-correct

though of course i still edit 
i wouldn't subject you to my initial stream of conscioussness
but i was good there's no way i'd revise
i'm only revising is to fill in gaps in my intuition. 

what i mean by that is: i'll be writing and feeling good and passionate and then think, "hm i'm kind of hungry right now i could go for some Panda" mid sentence and think "FUCK what was i typing where did the inspiration go" and kind of force myself forward, force words out, to try and trick myself back into that flow state but the words sound bad
and so there the words are emotionless and uncharged but i don't want to delete them because that's all i have and i just want to be done with this file
and i need to tend and optimize and revise to make them palatable
 
that's why i revise
if i could write 1000 words straight with an expansive playful awareness feeling good the whole time i'd publish it immediately
fuck a spelling mistake they add character

so, though it may not look it, this has all been second-guessed
but only second-guessed, not third or fourth
i'm curious what the difference will be
